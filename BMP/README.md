# .BMP

A program that spells out ".BMP" -- and converts .BMP images from RGB to Grayscale.

Yet another version of this project:
https://github.com/violeta-desantis/BMP-RGB-to-Grayscale

I originally shortened the project for Code Golf (to 333 bytes, at the time of writing):
https://github.com/violeta-desantis/CodeGolf/tree/main/bmp_gray

Then, I wanted to reshape that shortened code into ".BMP". 
I liked the way it turned out, so I made this repo.
